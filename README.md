## 📌 Abstract

This project estimates the **causal impact** of post-secondary education on wages and employment probabilities for early-career adults (aged 25–40) in Canada. Using **2021 Canadian Census data**, we apply a **Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS)** method with "moved for education" as an instrumental variable. Results indicate a **monotonic increase in wages** with higher education, but **nonlinear employment effects**, challenging the notion that higher education universally improves job prospects.

## 🧠 Research Question

**What is the causal effect of different levels of post-secondary educational attainment on wages and employment outcomes among early-career Canadians?**

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Data:** 2021 Canadian Census (cross-sectional)
- **Instrumental Variable:** Binary indicator for “Moved for education”
- **Estimation:**  
  - 2SLS for log wages  
  - Logistic regression for employment status  
- **Controls:** Age group, gender, province, family income, citizenship status

The approach identifies **Local Average Treatment Effects (LATE)** for individuals whose education was influenced by relocating.

## 📈 Key Results

- **Wages:** Increase **monotonically** with higher education levels, with the **largest gain at the Master’s level**.
- **Employment:** Does **not follow a strictly increasing trend**; some advanced degrees are associated with **lower or flat employment rates**.
- Instrument is **strong** (F-statistic > 700), and results are robust to inclusion of controls.
